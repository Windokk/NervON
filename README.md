# NervON

NervON is an Open Source project that aims to read and translate human thoughts into a computer. The main objective is to create a virtual world in which millions of people could meet while being totally immersed in this game. ðŸŽ®

Our immediate objectives : 1- Create a first prototype of an electroencephalograph to be able to carry out more in-depth research on how the human brain behaves when it walks, jumps and moves members of its body.

2- Create a microcomputer able to read and process data from the EEG (ElectroEncephaloGraph) and display answers on a screen.

3- Create an operating system called "NervOS" to process received data and send back data that the EEG will implant in the player's brain to simulate information received by his 5 senses and thus make him interact visually and audibly with the virtual world.

The NervOn Game : This will be a MMORPG game, free to play and totaly multiplayer (there won't be any story ; just finishing the game with or whitout collaborating with other players). We want to focus on the "immersion" part : this is why we want to create a game with extremely realistic visuals, and sounds more real than life to simulate a world very similar to ours but where EVERYTHING is possible.

How and why you should contribute : The point is that we have very few financial resources and this project unfortunately requires a lot. That's why we decided to open a Tipeee page so that motivated people like us can help financially to realize this project. No possibility of giving your money for nothing: you will be able to follow our purchases in real time, because we will share our orders and components received every day on the devlogs of the "sourceforge" part. You completely decide the amount of your donation and you will of course be rewarded according to the amount when the project is completed.

You can also participate by submitting your candidacy as a game or operating system developer to our email address: nervon.official.project@gmail.com
